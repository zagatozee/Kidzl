        <i>Kidzl</i> Is a child focussed game based on <i>hello wordl</i> which of course is a remake of the word game{" "}
        <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">
          <i>Wordle</i>
        </a>{" "}
        by <a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish">powerlanguage</a>, which
        I think is based on the TV show <i>Lingo</i>.

        You get {maxGuesses} tries to guess a target word.
        <br />
        After each guess, you get Mastermind-style feedback.
        <br />
        With Kidzl, the keyboard changes with the Word Difficulty slider.
        The black keys show that those letters are not possibly in the word.
        This is a simple way to restrict the likely words to only sounds that the child may have started to learn.
        <br />
        Every second step of the slider when moving to the right, the keyboard doesn't change, as the same letter list is being used - BUT - the change is that "tricky" words are being added to the potential word list.
